**Abstract:** Data-driven systems are gathering increasing amounts of data from users, and sensitive user data requires privacy protections. In some cases, the data gathered is non-numerical or symbolic, and conventional approaches to privacy, e.g., adding noise, do not apply, though such systems still require privacy protections. Accordingly, we present a novel differential privacy framework for protecting trajectories generated by symbolic systems. These trajectories can be represented as words or strings over a finite alphabet. We develop new differential privacy mechanisms that approximate a sensitive word using a random word that is likely to be near it. An offline mechanism is implemented efficiently using a Modified Hamming Distance Automaton to generate whole privatized output words over a finite time horizon. Then, an online mechanism is implemented by taking in a sensitive symbol and generating a randomized output symbol at each timestep. This work is extended to Markov chains to generate differentially private state sequences that a given Markov chain could have produced. Statistical accuracy bounds are developed to quantify the accuracy of these mechanisms, and numerical results validate the accuracy of these techniques for vechicle trajectories.
