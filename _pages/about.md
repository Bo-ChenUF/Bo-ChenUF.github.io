Hello! I am Bo Chen, a final-year Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida. I am under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Hale and am a member of [the Control, Optimization, and Robotics Engineering (CORE) Lab](https://corelab.mae.ufl.edu/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2017 with a major in Aerospace Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China. I also obtained my Master of Science degree, specializing in Aerospace Engineering, from the University of Florida in 2019.

**Research Interests:**
I am interested in developing novel privacy-enhanced tools to facilitate the sharing and analysis of sensitive data. My focus lies particularly in privatizing data generated by control-related systems, such as path planning systems and multiagent control systems, with a strong mathematical protection of differential privacy. Two of my recent projects have focused on privatizing <a href="../_publications/2023_Differential_Privacy_in_Cooperative_Multiagent_Planning" style="color: red">inner-agent communications</a> in cooperative multiagent decision-making problems, and on confidentially sharing [networked disease-spreading models](/bo-chenuf.github.io/publications/) along with their corresponding basic reproduction numbers.
